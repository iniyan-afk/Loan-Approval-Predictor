# Loan-Approval-Predictor
I worked on a loan eligibility prediction project where the goal was to determine whether a person qualifies for a loan based on their financial and demographic information. I implemented two approaches: an XGBoost classification model for high-accuracy predictions, and a neural network based classification model to provide a comparative baseline. The models were trained and evaluated using real-world loan application datasets.

In the output csv file, id denotes the person and loan status = 1 implies that the person should be given loan, and loan status = 0 shouldn't be given loan
